I am on a mission to understand my pain. The first piece of the puzzle involves understanding how it is affected by weather. This project is an attempt to do that.

There are two scripts in the repo:
1. getWeatherData.py - web scraping tool for the yr.no historical weather data
2. visualizeWeatherData.py - nifty tool for visualizing the weather data

Let me know if you have issues using the code.
